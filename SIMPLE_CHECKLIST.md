## 🧹 Step 1: Clean Up Your Files (5 minutes)

### **DELETE These Files** (they're mistakes):

- [ ] In `components/` folder → Delete `GSAPNavigationDots.tsx`
- [ ] In `components/` folder → Delete `SimpleNavigationDots.tsx`

### **MOVE These Folders** (they need to go inside src/):
- [ ] Drag the `components/` folder → Drop it inside the `src/` folder
- [ ] Drag the `imports/` folder → Drop it inside the `src/` folder
